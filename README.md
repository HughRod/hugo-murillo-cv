Hello world! :earth_americas: My name is Hugo and writing code is one of my passions :star2:.

As I was wrapping up my **Git/GitHub Udemy** course, I was told that this version control system is not only to manage code but also it can manage many different things. For a while, I thought about different things that I could use **Git** with to demonstrate that last statement, and one day it came to my mind the thought of versioning my own resumé. I think versioning my CV is spot on because it is a document that changes over time, and sometimes the changes on it might be major ones and you might want to keep track on all those, and keeping a number of files becomes cumbersome at certain point. Moreover, I think reading through the lines of a markdown document is easier, but even more so is the fact that a **GitHub** repository is easier to share and update.
