Hello world! :earth_americas: My name is Hugo and writing code is one of my passions :star2:.

As I was wrapping up my **Git/GitHub Udemy** course, I was told that this version control system is not only to manage code but also it can manage many different things. For a while, I thought about different things that I could use **Git** with to demonstrate that last statement, and one day it came to my mind the thought of versioning my own resumé. I think versioning my CV is spot on because it is a document that changes over time, and sometimes the changes on it might be major ones and you might want to keep track on all those, and keeping a number of files becomes cumbersome at certain point. Moreover, I think reading through the lines of a markdown document is easier, but even more so is the fact that a **GitHub** repository is easier to share and update.

## :pushpin: Experience

- ## **[2021 - present] NTT DATA — Engineer Front-End Angular Developer**

  After 3 years as a back-end developer, I started feeling more interested about **front-end** techonolgies and I can relate that to me being a very visual person. After resigning my first job, I decided to study **Angular**. I took more than 2 months of preparation, took 2 courses and once I felt prepared enough I was contacted by the NTT DATA company to apply to an open role as a **Angular** developer. This time though, I got assigned to a project with an international client and I am making use of my second language: English. So far, I have grown as a developer big time. I have got to **interact with the client in English**, talk to people with different English accents, I have written **CSS** and **SCSS** to create beautiful user interfaces, and I am much more involved than before as I have made recommendations and contributed a lot. Not to mention how much my English has improved.

  Other important things I have done are welcoming new co-workers to the project and walk them through the project so they get as much context of what it is about and what they will be doing. I have learned through time that, the key to making new project mates feel more confident about joining in is having a well orginised project. And that can be achieved by having well-done documentation and having all types of resources easily accessible through something like **Jira**.

  **Jira** is a project management tool that I got to know about in this company. I am currently learning about it to understand how much we can do through using it, but I have already made use of it a lot to keep track on the project tasks, bugs, documentation and so on.

  **Documentation** is something I have worked on too, not only to provide it to the client but also to co-workers that join the project.

- ## **[2018 - 2021] Back-End Laravel Developer**

  This was my **first and formal job**. I was hired by an IT company of my home town as a **Laravel** back-end developer. However, I was also in charge of the front-end duties but I was provided with templates so I did not have to worry much about CSS, just about some minor adjustments. **Laravel** includes options to create some HTML pages that are already prebuilt so you can skip a lot of work creating the Login, Registration, Forgot Password, and so on, pages and the back-end logic behind.

  I had to take care of designing the **database** and **attended a few meetings with potential clients**. What I think this job gave me the most is, I gained a lot of understandment of what happens under the hood when interacting with a graphic user interface and think of ways of comunicating with the front-end. This level of understandment shows in my current job as a front-end developer because I can understand how the endpoints are built and what could possible be happening on the server when getting an error. I could say too that, I now know much better how to understand the requirements of the client and bring them to reality through code.

  I was also able to work on some **documentation** along the way, and got to discover that is something I genuinely enjoy doing.
