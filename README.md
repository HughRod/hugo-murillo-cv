Hello world! :earth_americas: My name is Hugo and writing code is one of my passions :star2:.

As I was wrapping up my **Git/GitHub Udemy** course, I was told that this version control system is not only to manage code but also it can manage many different things. For a while, I thought about different things that I could use **Git** with to demonstrate that last statement, and one day it came to my mind the thought of versioning my own resumé. I think versioning my CV is spot on because it is a document that changes over time, and sometimes the changes on it might be major ones and you might want to keep track on all those, and keeping a number of files becomes cumbersome at certain point. Moreover, I think reading through the lines of a markdown document is easier, but even more so is the fact that a **GitHub** repository is easier to share and update.

## :pushpin: Experience

- ## **[2018 - 2021] Laravel Back-End Developer**

  This was my **first and formal job**. I was hired by an IT company of my home town as a **Laravel** back-end developer. However, I was also in charge of the front-end duties but I was provided with templates so I did not have to worry much about CSS, just about some minor adjustments. **Laravel** includes options to create some HTML pages that are already prebuilt so you can skip a lot of work creating the Login, Registration, Forgot Password, and so on, pages and the back-end logic behind.

  I had to take care of designing the **database** and **attended a few meetings with potential clients**. What I think this job gave me the most is, I gained a lot of understandment of what happens under the hood when interacting with a graphic user interface and think of ways of comunicating with the front-end. This level of understandment shows in my current job as a front-end developer because I can understand how the endpoints are built and what could possible be happening on the server when getting an error. I could say too that, I now know much better how to understand the requirements of the client and bring them to reality through code.

  I was also able to work on some **documentation** along the way, and got to discover that is something I genuinely enjoy doing.
